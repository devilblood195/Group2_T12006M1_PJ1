            <p>
                Nexus Aquarium is a popular weekend destination for many families with young children. This is a useful space for children to have fun and improve their knowledge about marine life.

                <p>“Every time you dive, you hope you’ll see something new – some new species. Sometimes the ocean gives you a gift, sometimes it doesn’t.” – James Cameron

                    The director of Titanic, James Cameron, directed a sleeper film many years before his blockbuster called Abyss. In this science fiction film, he takes the viewers to the bottom of the ocean. While the main characters encounter a benevolent alien life (I did say it was science fiction), his quote reminds us that there is a hidden world in the ocean.
                    
                    Watching aquatic life has a different tempo to watching animals in a zoo or safari. The soundtrack of the aquarium has a mellow rhythm as we watch uniquely shaped creatures that spark our imagination.

                    <p>Enhances Vocabulary</p>
                    <p>
                        For infants, there will be extensive visual stimulation which is great for their cognitive development. Talk about what they are seeing and identify animals. For toddlers, this is a great location to further develop vocabulary through identification. Read the signs posted as not only will they learn new words, you might as well. More importantly, reading out loud is great modeling that encourages your children to enjoy reading. For preschoolers, go a step beyond and discuss comparisons. While for my children, most fish are going to be fish, we have started identifying penguins as such and not birds.

                    <p>
                        Touch Tanks are usually one of the features available for the curious. Our eyes will definitely have plenty of visual stimulation, but we also absorb information through touch. For children, it is another method to better understand our world. In some of the aquariums we have visited our children have touched: sharks (the nice friendly kind), Stingrays, shrimp, hermit crabs and starfish to name a few. The tactile feedback provides another layer to this learning experience.

                    <p>
                        In the four aquariums we have visited there is an internal soundtrack being played that has helped calm me. I am a very high-strung individual, but in the aquarium it maintains a zen like quality. Not once have we felt pushed or our space invaded and this is important when you are sensitive to too many people or noises.
                        <br>
                        At the Maritime Aquarium, we loved watching the jellyfish shadowed in purple in a circular room. As a family, we shared a quiet moment. A similar moment was found in the Tropical Southwest Diver section of the Georgia Aquarium. I call this a meditative space. It is a great time to just sit and breathe. As well, this is a good place for your child to just appreciate life.

                    <p>Sparks Imagination</p>
                    <p>
                        At one point Christopher Columbus mistakenly identified manatees as mermaids. If you don’t know what a manatee is then go visit an aquarium! There are unusual life forms under the sea and thus it is a great place to spark your child’s imagination. The diverse colors, shapes and textures can provide inspiration for our imagination. Visiting aquariums has helped me redefine what lives in the water and will definitely surprise you and your family.

                <p>Educational Programs</p>
                <p>
                    Aquariums will have educational programs specifically designed for various age groups but their availability depends on resources and funds. It is best to search their website online to see what you can download prior to visiting including the schedule of activities (and if there is a cost). At the Maritime Aquarium, for a small fee, children can decorate and build their own wooden boat. Some aquariums also have webcams available which might interest your children before the visit and as a follow-up to the visit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aquariums are magical and scientific all at the same time. They provide lots of educational opportunities for your children as well as lifetime memories for the family.
